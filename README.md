## üß† Machine Learning Fraud Detection

RiskVision uses a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in real time. Here‚Äôs how the ML logic is implemented:

### Model Training
- The ML model is trained offline using historical transaction data (features: amount, country, hour, etc.).
- A country encoder is used to convert country names to numeric codes for the model.
- The trained model (`fraud_model.pkl`) and encoder (`country_encoder.pkl`) are stored in the `ml/` directory.

### ML API (FastAPI)
- The ML model is served via a FastAPI app (`ml/ml_api.py`).
- The API exposes a `/predict` endpoint that accepts transaction details (amount, country, hour) and returns a fraud prediction (`isFraud: 0 or 1`).
- Example request:
  ```json
  {
    "amount": 5000,
    "country": "United States",
    "hour": 14
  }
  ```
- The API encodes the country, constructs the feature vector, and returns the model‚Äôs prediction.

### Backend Integration
- When a new transaction is created, the backend calls the ML API `/predict` endpoint.
- The backend stores the `isFraud` result with the transaction and uses it for all fraud-related logic.
- All previous rule-based risk scoring and alerting logic have been removed.

### Frontend Integration
- Dashboards and case management now display and use the ML-driven fraud status (`isFraud`) instead of risk scores.
- Compliance and investigators work with ML-flagged transactions and cases.

### Why ML?
- ML enables more accurate, data-driven fraud detection compared to static rules.
- The system can be retrained and improved as more data is collected.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager


üîç How the ML Integration Works
When a transaction is created in the backend, it automatically calls the ML API
The ML API receives transaction data (amount, country, hour) and returns fraud prediction
The backend stores the isFraud result with the transaction
The frontend displays ML-driven fraud status instead of risk scores
